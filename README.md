# Greetings, whoever sees this!
My name is Kareem, and I was born in Syria. Ever since my brother showed me Python, I've wanted to create programs with Python. It looked easy, and then I started to learn some functions myself. The first function my brother ever taught me in Python was probably `input()`.

I hope you all have a great time.

Sincerely,
  Kareem
